# app.html [ARCHIVED - LEGACY SINGLE-USER BRIDGE]

**Status:** ARCHIVED - See room.html instead

This is the original single-user bridge interface. It has been superseded by:
- **room.html** - Modern multi-room entry point
- **dashboard.html** - Creator management
- **api/room/** endpoints - Backend room logic

The single-user bridge functionality is now integrated into the multi-room system.

**Why archived:** Kept for reference but no longer used in active development.

**Legacy note:** This was the MVP proof-of-concept before multi-tenant architecture was implemented.
