  // Return { url: checkout_url, sessionId }
}

export async function getCheckoutSession(sessionId) {
  // Retrieve session details
  // Return { status, customer, paymentIntent, ... }
}

export function constructWebhookEvent(body, signature) {
  // Verify Stripe signature
  // Return parsed event or throw error
}

// api/webhooks/stripe.js structure
export async function processStripeWebhook(event) {
  // Route by event type
  if (event.type === 'checkout.session.completed') {
    // Update subscription to ACTIVE
    // Send confirmation email
  }
}

// api/creator/subscribe.js routing
if (provider === 'stripe') {
  const session = await createCheckoutSession({
    creatorId, planType, amount
  });
  return { status: 200, body: { url: session.url } };
}
```

## Questions & Decisions

### Q: Why Manual First, Then Stripe, Then CCBill?
**A:** Risk mitigation. Manual payments work without external providers (fallback to console), allowing MVP launch. Stripe adds 70% of payment volume. CCBill is backup for creators who need monthly recurring (no upsell).

### Q: What About Apple Pay / Google Pay?
**A:** Both Stripe and CCBill support them natively. Included in Phase 3.2 & 3.3.

### Q: How Do We Handle Payment Failures?
**A:** Retry logic in webhook handlers. Admin can manually approve/reject payments that fail. Email reminders sent after 7 days.

### Q: What About Refunds/Chargebacks?
**A:** Phase 4 hardening. Automated refund handling via Stripe/CCBill webhooks. Chargeback workflow with admin escalation.
