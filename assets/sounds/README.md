# After Hours Audio Assets

This directory contains audio files for the After Hours portal.

## Required Files

- `tip.mp3` - Sound effect played when a tip is received

## Note

Audio files are not included in the repository (see `.gitignore`). 
To use the audio alert feature, add your own `tip.mp3` file to this directory.

You can use any short notification sound (1-3 seconds recommended).
